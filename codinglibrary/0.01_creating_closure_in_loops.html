//A common issue with loops is is that closures share the same single environment
//Take a look at example 1 in both html and js

<!--Example 1: Loops that share the same environment-->

<p id="help">Helpful notes will appear here</p>
<p>E-mail: <input type="text" id="email" name="email"></p>
<p>Name: <input type="text" id="name" name="name"></p>
<p>Age: <input type="text" id="age" name="age"></p>

//The reason this does not work is because the three closures that have been created share the same environement.
//By the time the callbacks are executed, the loop has run its course and the item variable(which is shared by all three closures) is left pointing to the last entry.

<!--Example 2: Shows how to correct this using more closures-->

//Use the same html code from example 1 for example 2. 

//This calls back what you would expect, 3 different "help" callbacks.  

<!--Example 3: Shows another way of doing this same thing using the more prefered let keyword. 

//Use the same html code from example 1 for example 3.
